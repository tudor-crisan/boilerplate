- when searching for posts in public boards, it shouldn't show the empty state , but rather to say "No posts found" and the <SvgSearch /> icon
- have a notification system, to get notified when new posts/votes/comments are added to boards (and on each individual boards, some sort of analytics)
- have a separate page to view analytics of all boards, and how everything is performing
- have a notification system for weekly updates on all boards, number of posts/votes/comments/visits, like a summary
