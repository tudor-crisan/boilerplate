- when no posts added for a board, have a svg or message to say it's empty
- have the same message for boards as well, somewhere inside the <ListDisplay>
- don't show the "Board updated" when the event is from the same browser
- remove the initials at least from `Welcome back "Cristina" with intials "CR". You're logged in from "c6678982@gmail.com"`
- move the redirect "/dashboard" paths into the boards.json module to easily re-use (and update components)
- add the metadata for terms, privacy and support as well in the settings
- create a webhook for resend received emails to forward them to main email address
- remove loading on link to support email on privacy page (check other buttons that auto-load)
- have redirect - when logged-in on /auth/error or /auth/verify-request to a path to have the "Go to dashboard" button and the message
- emit event - when deleting on private board to also delete on public board
- add emit events in other places of the app to make sure they are in sync
