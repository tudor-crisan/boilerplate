we need the following 

- a notification system, to get notified when new posts/votes/comments are added to boards (and on each individual boards, saving these statistics)
- a separate page to view analytics of all boards, and how everything is performing
- on the dashboard do display a bit of stats and notifications of new changes
- on individual o boards notifications of recent updates, and analytics for that board
- a email notification system for weekly updates on all boards, number of posts/votes/comments/visits, like a summary of all the activity to be send on a weekly basis

analyze the current system, and think how all of this can be implemented
