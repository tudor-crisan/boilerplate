- make it that it doesn't delete the others, so the tudorcrisan.dev can have the portfolio of apps, and the others the tudorcrisan logo
- put the same title/paragraph in the youtube/x banners as is on tudorcrisan.dev
- put the portfolio items on tudorcrisan.dev
- when deleting a board, show toast message that the board is deleted and will be incative, and be redirected in 15 seconds
- have a way to edit the board link slug, and use slugs when possible (with checks for existing board names)
- have a settings panel to change the theme, style of the page, such as shadows, borders, roundness (from lb0_settings)
- have a top menu for changing the billing, logout, my profile, initials, name and others for users
- problem with event stream not working on the vercel online deployment
- remove the initials at least from `Welcome back "Cristina" with intials "CR". You're logged in from "c6678982@gmail.com"`
- create a webhook for resend received emails to forward them to main email address
- make it either $10/month or pay $60 one-time, no monthly subcriptions (change the SectionPricing and make it with modal for subscribe in dashboard)
- make a video screenrecording demo of the app how it works, behind the scenes and everything
- specify in the copywriting, that it works on mobile also, even dashboard, and that it updates in real time when users create posts/upvotes
- look at the /success page to figure out how it can be better done
