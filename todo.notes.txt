- figure out at email-theme.js to get out the shadows, borders, roundness
- find through the project the useStyling, and figure out if we can standardize repeatable implementations
- fix the space- and add them to the lb0_styling to be re-used

- check app\auth\error\page.js and app\auth\verify-request\page.js what they have in common
- move the redirect "/dashboard" paths into the boards.json module to easily re-use (and update components)
- have redirect - when logged-in on /auth/error or /auth/verify-request to a path to have the "Go to dashboard" button and the message
- have a way to edit the board link slug, and use slugs when possible (with checks for existing board names)
- have a settings panel to change the theme, style of the page, such as shadows, borders, roundness (from lb0_settings)
- have a top menu for changing the billing, logout, my profile, initials, name and others for users
- problem with event stream not working on the vercel online deployment
- remove the initials at least from `Welcome back "Cristina" with intials "CR". You're logged in from "c6678982@gmail.com"`
- create a webhook for resend received emails to forward them to main email address
- make it either $10/month or pay $60 one-time, no monthly subcriptions (change the SectionPricing and make it with modal for subscribe in dashboard)
- make a video screenrecording demo of the app how it works, behind the scenes and everything
- specify in the copywriting, that it works on mobile also, even dashboard, and that it updates in real time when users create posts/upvotes
