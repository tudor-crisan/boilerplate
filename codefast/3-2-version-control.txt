Version Control
 - at some point you want a lot of features, and maybe you change your mind
 - if you want to get back to previous version we need a tool called "git"

Git
 - it will store all previous versions of your code, lets you go back in time
 - in case you lose your code, you can have it uploaded to "github"
 - in case we want to work with multiple developers, to have a common application

Install
 - go to git-scm.com/download and install for win or mac
 - on a mac for git we need homebrew, go ahead and install that one (google it)
 - do step-by-step what it says, then "brew install git"

---

Init/Commit
 - git init - to initiliaze a new git project, or "Initialize repository" in vscode
 - git commit - and add a message "first commit" or "."

Git config
 - we need to set-up the global email and username
 - git config --global user.email "tudor.crisan.webdev@gmail.com"
 - git config --global user.name "tudor.crisan"

Git publish branch
 - it will ask you for a github account
 - sign-up with your email address
 - it's kinda like google drive for developers
 - now authorize vscode to sign-in with github

Git push
 - in vscode on the "source control" on the left click "Publish branch"
 - select "Private repository" and select the github username to push

Git workflow
 - the workflow is always the same, we are going to make changes on application
 - the test it, then commit it, push it to the branch, and have it stored online

---

Git file diff
 - changed files are with yellow, with M next to them indicating they are modified
 - we have on the left the previous version, and on the right the changed version
 - we can then add it, clicking the + icon, then put the message and see it in github

Git timeline
 - we can see the differences and activity that was done a file
 - useful if something breaks, or want to see previous version of something

Git ignore
 - .gitignore - it's the file of things we don't want to track
 - it's gray out, because we don't want to track there, since we have package.json
