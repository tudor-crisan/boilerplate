PROMISE
 - JavaScript is synchronous, meaning it will go over the code and execute each line
 - Promise - to handle requests, such as having a loading until request is done, then setState
 - using .then() / .catch() to send data from requests, and update the useState

ASYNC/AWAIT
 - used to write code that looks synchronous, but it's asynchronous
 - async getImage() { const response = await fetch(url) }
 - const data = await response.json();

Try/Catch
 - if the error happens, we need try/catch when we do async/await
 - without try/catch the whole app breaks - we need to tell users nicely
 - try { // code } catch(e) { console.error(e) }
 - throw new Error(e) - it's to stop the whole app
 - used to catch when javascript breaks so the app keeps going
