Dynamic pages

- /b/[boardId]
export default async function FeedbackBoard({ params }) {
  const { boardId } = await params;
  return <div>{boardId}</div>;
}

private board page
- Board.findOne({ _id: boardId, userId: session?.user?.id })
- use try/catch to return the new value from those

public board page
- import { getBoardPublic } from "@/libs/apps/boards/db";
- const board = await getBoardPublic(boardId);

deleting boards
- create first the api endpoint
- refactor the FormCreate and ButtonDelete to have a hook for errors and success

serialization
- taking a complex mongo data, turn it simple, send it into react
- to do that we use .toString() ... we need this for ObjectId(...)
