DNS Records
 - when owning a domain, we own all the subdomains under it
 - domain.com / www.domain.com / blog.domain.com / *.domain.com
 - TYPE | NAME | VALUE
 - A @ 76.76.21.21 - address, map a request to an ip address (@ - root of domain, or www. blog.)
 - CNAME www. otherdomain.com - if we want to redirect to another domain
 - MX @ mxa.mailgun.org - what to do when an incoming email comes to domain
 - TXT @ k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0G - those are public, anyone can see them (eg. to show you own the domain)
