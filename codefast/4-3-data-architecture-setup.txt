Data architecture
 - It's good to think of the data that's going to be available
 - User - Boards - Posts - Votes
 - Users can create feedback boards (empty at first)
 - Each user can add posts to the feedback board
 - Each user can give a upvote for each post

User { _id, name, email, boards[] }
  Board { _id, userId, name }
   Post { _id, userId, boardId, title, description }
     Vote { _id, userId, postId }

Mongoose
 - since we are using mongodb we can write anything / anywhere
 - we want to have a little bit of structure, so we use mongoose
 - libs/mongoose.js - new connection, while keeping the mongo.js for auth

Schema
 - schema is the infrastructure, and models are the ones on top of schemas
 - for each collection we have in the database we need to create one model
 - models/ - new folder - const boardSchema = new mongoose.Schema();
    // lowercase: true,
    // minLength: 5,
    // default: "a board"

Models
 - models are built on top of schema, the bridge between code and database
 - we are using them to create / delete / update etc
const Board = mongoose.model("Board", boardSchema);
// Board.find()
// Board.delete()
const Board = mongoose.models.Board || mongoose.model("Board", boardSchema);
 - this way we make sure we are not creating the model again and again

Users
 - we need to create this one too, since at some point we need to query the db
 - we use ref to know which document collection refers to so we can link them
 - we can then get a board and populate the date of that user also
