SectionHeader
 - 3 divs - for the appName , menus (no Link needed) we scroll on page, and login
 - we can go an see the base colors, primary and everything in daisyui
 - we are using bg-base-200 for the top menu

flex
 - flex - it changes display: flex and all are inline and use minimum width needed
 - flex-row - default, elements inline left to right
 - flex-col - elements will be vertical, one after the other
 - justify-center - all elements will be aligned in center
 - justify-between - elements inside will be pushed as far between
 - justify-start - at the start of the section, or -end at the end
 - items-strecth - default, it means they will take as much space as they can
 - items-start - at the start positioned, -end at the end, and -center at the center
 - space-x-4 - for the top menus to have space between them
 - space-y-4 - to add space on the vertical axis

responsive & media-queries
 - usually it looks good on desktop but doesn't look good on mobile
 - media-query - we can filter for mobile/desktop, sizes, distances
 - sm (640px) mobile - md (768px) tablet - lg (1024px) laptop - xl (1280px) screens
 - flex-col | flex-row - to display on mobile as vertical
 - font-size - to be reduced on mobile devices - lg:text-5xl 
 - hidden md:block - it's hidden for smaller than tablet, but for larger is visible
 - max-md:hidden - it's hidden until it reaches the tablet size

---

SectionPricing
 - section with title, text, a card, all the features, price, button to get started
 - bg-base-100 - is the default of the website, so putting bg-base-200 changes it a bit
 - bg-base-200 - is the one we are using for the section to differentiate
 - text-primary - a new class that adds the primary color from the button
 - daisyui card component - search a good one from daisyui to design the pricing section
 - flex items-baseline - to have the text at the bottom with the pricing
 - font-black - for the pricing to be the maximum of bold up to 900
 - <ul> - unorganized list, to display the features

svg (math vectors)
 - svg or images for adding the thick item 
 - image is made of pixels, while svg can scale
 - it can scale and looks the same, it doesn't need to make another request
 - its best to use svg's instead of images, for size, performance - heroicons.com
 - xmlns, viewbox - we don't bother of these
 - stroke - is what we actually see, color / width
 - fill - is what's inside it

useful tips
 - text-primary - changes the color of line of the svg
 - size-4 - is instead of putting w-4 and h-4
 - svg's for html we can't use in jsx files
 - space-y-2 - on the <ul> container, since it works for display block elements such as the <li>
 - a lot better than putting mb everywhere

ternary operator
 - it's used if/else inline
 - const age = 19; let canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No"

eslint rules
 - it shows where it's broken, but sometimes we might not see the error immediately
 - that's why eslint will catch, lets say we say "ages" instead of age

template literals
 - combining strings - `Hello ${name}` (under back thicks)
 - it introduces the variables, or other operations, or even new lines
 - we can do ternary inside template literals - `Hello ${isLoggedIn ? name : 'there'}`
 - really useful in javascript to render better strings
 - with normal strings we put \n

component customization
 - we want ButtonLogin to have different width/class
 - extraStyle = '' - as a prop inside the component to add more classes

javascript arrays
 - a list of elements - const fruits = ['a', 'b', 'c']
 - fruits[0] - 'a' , the index being zero
 - fruits.length - 3 | fruits.pop() - remove last one
 - fruits.push('d') - pushes another one into the array at the end
 - fruits.forEach(el => console.log(el)) - iterates through the elements
 - const fruitsParagraphs = fruits.map(el => (<p>{el}</p>)}) - it returns the new array
 - const fruitsWithoutA = fruits.filter(fruit => fruit !== 'a') - it returns all the others
 - they are not limited to any type of value - const stuff = ['a', 23, false, ['c','d']]

javascript jsx
 - we want to make the listicle a little bit cleaner inside our code
 - {pricingTable.map(el => (<li>...</li>))}
 - when using the .map we need to add a key={} for children
 - we can replace the array directly inside the jsx and map it
 - when functions return just one thing, we can have arrow function inline

useState hook
 - is a special function to manage stateful functions
 - when updating it changes the entire appearence of the page
 - [name, setName] - its destructuring the main variable and the function to modify it

server and client components
 - the browser doesn't understand components, so they must be rendered, either on browser or next.js
 - by default all components are server components - only if we specify "use client"
 - it has advantages, because it's private - console.log shows only on the server, in node.js
 - another big advantage is that we send only what the user need, it goes faster

using client components
 - if we want to useState or onClick we need to make it a client component, "use client" at the top
 - it sends the js/html and react will render them inside the clients browser
 - we shouldn't keep sensitive information inside these

FAQ section
 - https://daisyui.com/components/accordion/ - take the jsx accordion, and use it with tailwind
 - <></> - react fragment, it returns multiple elements, or to do conditional rendering with it
 - condition ? <p>this</p> : <></>

Anchor links
 - we add id to the sections - #pricing #faq | we then put the href="#pricing"
 - we want a bit of scrolling to do it in any-page - html className="scroll-smooth"
 - the hash (#) means we stay on the page, we are not searching for a new page
 - if we put /#pricing on another page, it will link to the home page and go to the id

Image component
 - <img> - using just the html tag there are some drawbacks
 - we can import an image from the same folder file, <Image src={productDemo} alt="text" />
 - when importing vs adding the source in public folder it reduces based on width, height
 - when importing, width and height are not required, but with source they are

Style images
 - flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center space-y-6 - style properly the images
 - we can give an image "h-40" object-center | object-contain | object-cover
 - this way we adjust the image even though it's size is not properly positioned
 - grayscale - make it black  and white | saturate-200 the saturation and others
