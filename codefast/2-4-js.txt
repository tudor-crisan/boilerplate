JavaScript - Functionalities

- it's both on the browser and the server
client - v8 engine | server - node.js

v8 - change design, store values, make http requests
node.js - reply to http request, store in database, make api calls

---

console.log('hey future dev') - it logs in the console in browser
window.open('http://youtube.com) - it opens youtube.com
<script> - to include javascript inside the html page

---

variables
store data from users (let and const)

creating a counter:
 - let likesCounter = 0; (use words you understand, camelCase)
 - this sets the variable likesCounter to zero (and it can be changed)

types
typeof likesCounter (it shows the type of the variable, "number")
number - for numbers | string - for text | boolean - for true, false
undefined - when no value | null - for nothing there | '' - empty string

functions
const addLikes = (incrementBy) => likes += incrementBy
 - functions allow to run the same code more times, or when needed
 - it allows to pass parameters to modify behavior
 - they also return results, that can be later used
 - usually stored in const because they don't change
 - we can have a default parameter value incrementBy = 1
 - then we don't need to pass the value in the function

comments
// - used to explain what a piece of code is doing
 - it's really helpful to remember what this piece of code is doing

---

objects
const person = {
  name: 'Tudor',
  age: 36,
  hasJob: false
  greet: () => console.log('hi')
}

 - a new type to store related information
 - you can log them, console.log(person.age)
 - you can even store functions inside the object
 - you can execute the function person.greet()
 - you can change the values, person.name = 'Andrei'

events
 - we can listen to events from the page
 - we can get the document (the whole page)
 - we can do a querySelector function to find elements

document.querySelector('button') - gets the button element
.addEventListener() - to listen to events from the html element

document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', () => addLikes(1))

---

template strings
 - we can also use `${likesCounter} Likes` to display all likes
 - we can add/remove events, change text, and styles of elements with js

do-not-repeat-yourself
 - we want one variable to reference the html element
 - const likeButton = document.querySelector('button')
 - later when you want to use the element or function you can call it

separation-of-concerns
 - as the html file will grow it will be hard to manage
 - so we want to move the css and javascript into new files

<script src="index.js"></script>
<link href="style.css" />

if-else
 - if the user clicks on the like button 10 times we want to show a msg
 - we will use an if/else statement "if (condition) { }"
 - in real world we use it a lot, if user logged in, show dashboard
 - if user paid for the service, then provide feature
 - inside the condition we need a boolean true/false
