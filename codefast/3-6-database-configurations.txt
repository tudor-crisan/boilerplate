Database Configurations

API / Authenticate users / Store data somewhere
 - save users who signed-up / social media / store
 - client - site.com - server - database - api keys
 - SQL - structured query language (like spreadsheets)
 - NoSQL - data is store like javascript object (not strict)

MongoDB 
 - the nosql database - multiple documents = collection
 - Collection (users) / Collection (jobs) - eg. { "name": "Tudor" }
 - Database = all collections in which we have the documents (for each)
 - New business / new database - to store all data for that app
 - We can have 2, one for testing, one for production (to not break anything)

Atlas
 - mongodb.com/cloud/atlas - here we register a new account for the database
 - survey - fill the information with what ever feels right
 - M0 Free - select the cluster with 512Mb storage (AWS) - Cluster0
 - Disable - "preload sample dataset" - choose "us-east-1" as per vercel
 - Region - it's important the distances to be close between next.js and db
 - Connect to Cluster0 - add a connection ip address / create a database user
 - Compas - chose how to connect, save the connection string uri
 - Network access - on the left menu, set "allow access from everywhere"

Test
 - Cluster0 - connect / Browse collections - "Add my own data"
 - Database name / Collection name - Set these for test (production / jobs)
 - Insert Document - title: "Entrepreneur" - click "Save" to store the data
 - _id: ObjectId('6234234923482wqqe') - that's how they identify unique documents
 - we don't touch anything of this, since this is how we reference across milions of files

Compass
 - Download - mongodb.com/products/tools/compass
 - New connection - URI = <the-saved-uri-from-earlier>
 - Anyone with access to this can do anything, it has to remain private
 - mongodb+src://<username>:<password>@<cluster>mongodb.net
 - Find it on Atlast webpage, connect to cluster0, select compass
 - If forgot password - go to "Database access" - "Edit" - "Edit password"
 - Connect / Create database / Create collection / Insert document
{ "email": "tudor.crisan.webdev@gmail.com", "age": 36, "isEntrepreneur": true }
 - Query - to retrieve documents / filter / serach - { isEntrepeneur: true }
 - { age: { $gte: 30 } } - this query is to find age greater or equal to 30
 - double-click to edit any value / change type of data, String - Int32 - boolean
 - delete - the whole database by clicking the trash icon

Environment variables
 - .env.local - to store the variables
 - MONGO_URI - the one stored on docs-v3
 - .gitignore - will ignore sensitive information
 - it's specific for node.js - console.log(process.env.MONGO_URI)
 - it's how the node.js will locate the respective variable
 - we need to reference it in a server-side component, not client-side component
 - we can have different values based on the environments we are running
 - if we put /dev (we are going to connect to the dev database) - on production we put /prod
 - vercel - environment variables key / value - Environment Variables

MongoDB API
 - function - customizable to re-use everywhere in the code to update the db
 - libs/mongo.js - here is the adapter that we will use across the whole app
 - import clientPromise from "@/libs/mongo";
 - clientPromise.db.collection("users").fnd({ age: 32 });
