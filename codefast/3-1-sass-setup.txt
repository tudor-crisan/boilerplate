SaaS Setup
 - landing page to convice people to sign-up
 - to private dashboard where users perform actions
 - to charging payments, sending emails, AI to simplify

We are building http://insigh.to
 - software for anyone who wants to collect feedback from their users
 - if you have a service, course, product, sign-up and you have a board
 - that can be given to users to add features to prioritize

Techstack:
 - it's a list of tools used to build products
 - the services to send emails, collect payments etc

We are using:
 - modern technologies - html, css, javascript
 - tools - react.js, next.js, tailwind css

Customer first:
 - there are hundreds of services and tools for everything
 - it does not matter for the customer, they only want the solution
 - customers care about the problem you're solving for them

Don't change tech stack:
 - pick your techstack at the beginning, and stick to it
 - you are not going to face new bugs, or problems, that slow down
 - don't have fear of missing out, because of new tools, use the same

Here it is:
 - Language - JavaScript
 - Frontend - React / TailwindCSS / daisyUI / NextJS
 - Backend - NextJS / MongoDB / AuthJS
 - 3rd party - OAuth / Resend / Stripe

package.json (node_modules)
 - other already created pieces of code you already want
 - instead of creating the buttons from scratch, just get them from docs
 - if the developer change something, then you have to get them again
 - that's why we have node_modules to synchronize all packages

npmjs.com
 - this way we have all the components, code in one place
 - only requirement is to have a file called package.json
 - the file has the "scripts" to run, "dependencies" packages installed
 - it's formatted .json, similar to js, but object notation as constraint
 - also having quotes for keys, and for string values, true/false, numbers

dependencies
 - all the packages that the server for hosting needs to download
 - devDependencies are the ones needed to be installed on the dev environment
 - all packages will be added to the big node_modules folder

node_modules
 - there are more because some packages are required by others
 - we can see the tree of packages by going to package-lock.json

npm install (daisyui)
 - npm i -D daisyui@latest - installs as dependency
 - daisyui/docs - to check how to install it
 - page.js - <button className="btn">Click me</button>

scripts
 - npm run dev | npm run build (ctrl+c to stop server)
 - how to run the application on localhost, or on hosting (vercel)
 - npm run dev - to run locally to change files and see changes live
 - npm run build - to run the build on the server to host it
 - npm run lint - to run the linter to clean the code

npm packages
we can have for currency / resize images and many more / log-in or log-out
npm install {package}
npm update {package}
npm -D - to have devDependencies
npm run {script}
