Coding with AI

- Extension: GitHub.copilot - costs $10/month
- It knows stackoverflow / popular API for stripe
- Lives inside your code and knows your variables, functions etc.

How to use
- Embed Chat - We can ask question of stuff in the codebase (select and ask)
- Change Code - Select parts and say stuff that needs to be changed
- Code autocompletion - Github copilot autocompletes for next line

Tips
- Keep most of the tabs open so AI knows the entire code
- Naming matters - how we name variables determine the autocompletion
- Goes for Functions, Components, so it knows the intent of the files
- Comments - // create a portal session it will suggest what to code
- Add more details on comment it will give even better outputs
