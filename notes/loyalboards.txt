Yes! That opens up way more possibilities. Here are funny, memorable scenes that work for feedback boards for creators/YouTubers:

## Audience Feedback & Reactions

**"School of Rock" (2003)** - The battle of the bands scene where Jack Black watches the crowd's reaction. Text: "Wondering if your content hits?" → "Just ask your audience"

**"Pitch Perfect" (2012)** - The riff-off scene or any performance with crowd reactions. Caption: "Your viewers know what content they want" → "Create your feedback board"

**"Almost Famous" (2000)** - "I am a golden god!" scene where he's feeding off crowd energy. Text: "Creating content blindly" → "vs. Knowing what your audience loves"

## Creative Direction & Ideas

**"Ratatouille" (2007)** - Anton Ego's childhood flashback when he tastes the food. Overlay: "When you finally create what your audience wants" → "LoyalBoards: Let them tell you"

**"The Devil Wears Prada"** - The "cerulean blue" speech scene. Text: "You think you know what your audience wants..." → "But do you actually ask them?"

**"Finding Nemo" (2003)** - The seagulls screaming "Mine! Mine! Mine!" Caption: "Your comment section asking for features" → "Organize it with LoyalBoards"

## Viral/Relatable Humor

**"Mean Girls" (2004)** - "Stop trying to make fetch happen" scene. Text: "Stop pushing content nobody asked for" → "Let your audience vote on what they want"

**"The Incredibles" (2004)** - "We're dead! We're dead!" Dash panicking scene. Caption: "Posting without knowing what your audience wants" → "LoyalBoards: Get clarity"

**"Shrek" (2001)** - "Can you please stop talking?" Shrek to Donkey. Text: "Comment section chaos" → "Organized feedback boards instead"

These are more universally relatable to content creators and have strong viral potential!
